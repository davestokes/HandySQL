# HandySQL
Handy Structure Query Language Queries for a variety of databases.

This is a catalog of helpful database queries. The longer you use databases,
The more little scripts that you collect to provide vital insights
into the operation of your instances. 

It helps to know about queries running without an index or unused indexes.
Correcting either can improve the performance of your database.

In time, it is hoped that the list here can be expanded and will become
a handy reference. 

If you have queries to share, please let me know a) which database, b) what
the script does, and c) if there are any license restrictions.
